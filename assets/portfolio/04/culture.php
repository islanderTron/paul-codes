        <h1> Gu&aring;h&aring;n's Culture</h1>
        <p>The Chamorro people were the original group of ethnicity to live on Guam from the early 2,000 B.C.  Since the 16th century people from other countries have immigrated to Guam.  However, Chamorro’s culture including their language, music, dances, and traditions have survived to this day.</p>

        <p>Chamorro people have used advanced fishing, agricultural, and hunting skills to help them survive.  They knew how to make pottery from clay, to make the canoes for fishing purposes, and to make the complex weaving with leaves for clothes, bags, and other furnishings.</p>

        <p>Latte stones, as shown in the picture above, represents the symbol and the signature for Guam and Marianas Island.  It’s made from a combination of coral and limestone.  Each one can stand between 3 feet to 12 feet tall.  Latte stones were traditionally used as a foundation for structures which were used for a variety of purposes; such as housing, cooking huts, places of authority and many other possibilities.  Now latte stones are a symbol of the Chamorro's identity.</p>

        <p>Guam’s culture has been influenced by varieties of countries from Asia and Pacific Islands.  Currently about 170,000 people continue to be rooted to Guam’s culture.  There are many Chamorro and Filipino people who live on Guam, as well as other islanders who have immigrated.</p>
