        <p>During World War II, Japan seized Guam on December 10, 1941 for a short time.  American soldiers came to Guam and fought back to defeat the Japanese to retake Guam from their stronghold.  One of the reasons America wanted that island was because it supported America’s military as it was closer to Asia than Hawaii.  Now, Guam is a United States Territory.  Guam people continue to celebrate Liberation Day every year on July 21th to celebrate their freedom from Japan’s tyranny.</p>
