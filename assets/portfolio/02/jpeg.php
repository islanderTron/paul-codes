	                    <p>JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group and it is also the name of the committee that created this JPEG. JPEG is best known for photographs 

	                    	and natural scanned photographs. The compression is good when it does approximations. The positive aspect is that with low quality image, it 

	                    	downloads faster than usual. JPEG has some pros which are preservation of integrity photos, fast downloads, photography action, instant printing 

	                    	and saves space. The cons are the compression drawbacks, lack of photo quality, not reliable for all images and have limitations. </p>

	                    	

	                    <p>	If you want to use JPEG for web designs, it is not suited for it as it relies on nonâ€”realistic images such as logos, drawings, or cartoons. 

	                    	Additionally, if you design a website and it requires black and white images or motion compression, it is strongly not recommended. All browsers 

	                    	supports JPEG. In addition, the most common filename extensions for JPEG are .jpg and .jpeg. </p>

	                    	

	                    <p> There are several programs that can open .JPG files in Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The programs that are compatible with Windows

	                    	are Adobe Photoshop CC, Microsoft Windows Photos, Adobe Illustrator CC, Roxio Creator NXT Pro 2, and  any Web browser. With Mac OS, Apple Preview, 

	                    	Adobe Photoshop CC, Roxio Toast 11, and Apple Preview can open JPG files. There is only one program with Linux that can open JPG files is GIMP.
