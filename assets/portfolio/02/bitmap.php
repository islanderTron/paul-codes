	                    <p>Bitmap is one of the many file format types for the images to be stored in a computerized form. It is particularly for a precise picture when it 

	                    	is rendered to be displayed similarly to a computer monitor. Bitmaps produces beautiful images since bitmaps stores large information in high 

	                    	resolution. However, a bitmap image does not rescale well. If a graphic program blows up the image, it can produce a blurry and blocky image 

	                    	and if it is reduced, it loses its clarification. Since bitmap images are a pixel-by-pixel build, it can be edited easily. </p>

	                    	In any graphics program that allows the  user to edit, add, delete, or change the individual pixels colors is by zooming in on it for the 

	                    	user to get their image preference. The primarily reason for this is logos, favicons (a custom icon for website or webpage that is located next 

	                    	to the http address in the URL window of a browser), and icon images are commonly built in the bitmap format.
