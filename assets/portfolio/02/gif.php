	                    <p>	GIF stands for Graphic Interchange Format. The world was introduced to GIF which was first introduced by Compuserve in 1987. It was interesting 

	                    	that Alexander Trevor and his team, included Steve Wilhite, released the enhanced version of the GIF called 87a that allowed people to create 

	                    	compressed animations using timed delays. Currently, GIF’s animations can be saved as “animated GIF”.  GIF is also not recommended to use for 

	                    	photos since GIFS are limited to 256 colors. </p>

	                    	

	                    <p> Some programs that open .GIF files, that are compatible with Windows, are Adobe Photoshop CC and Elements 12, Corel PaintShop Pro X5, and Microsoft 

	                    	Windows Photo Viewer. Mac OS, Apple Safair, Adobe Illustrator CC, and Nuance OmniPage Pro X can open .GIF files. As for Linux, GIMP seems to be the 

	                    	only program. All of the internet browsers fully supports GIF. </p>
