	                    <p>PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics was initiated and created by two Israeli researchers, Jacob Ziv, Abraham Lempel, and Terry Welch who published their 
	                    	first papers on lossless data-compression algorithms. It is known as the replacement of the older and simple GIF format. PNG is a format that is a 
	                    	lossless bitmap which is popular on the World Wide Web and globally. In brief history, PNG was enormously developed to handle some of the GIF format 
	                    	shortcomings and allowed storage of greater color depth images along with other important images. </p>
	                    
	                    <p> This image format cannot be animated like GIF. PNG has three different styles that have allowed transparency, which one of it is for 
	                    	indexed color images and the other two are for grayscale or true color images. PNG is also commonly used for icons. PNG also offer a wide variety of
	                    	transparency options. There are several browsers that supports PNG, which are Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome. </p>
