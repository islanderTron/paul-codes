	            	<p> Our team name is Deaf Power for ISTE-240 Web II. We worked together to create a tutorial website.

	            		Our site goal is to inform the people about different kind of image formats and know which ones is the best to use on any project. Our mission is to 

	            		consistently deliver the excellent information about the image formats, so the users can learn how to use their images properly and enjoy their 

	            		experience from our website. Additionally, on the side, it could draw potential clients in the future if they requested for us to create a website 

	            		for them. </p>

						

						<p>Look below where the pictures are and hover over them that contains brief information about each one of us. We created this website using PHP, CSS, and

	            		JavaScript. </p>
