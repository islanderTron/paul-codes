	                    <p>TIFF is the abbreviation for Tagged Image File Format. TIFF is specified for the simple image geometry image.  For example, it shows how the 
	                    	image’s size or how the image’s arrangement and various image compression options are defined.  With TIFF, it gives the option to include all 
	                    	different kinds of image formats in the file. This image format is good for storing large, high quality images and it also is preferred for graphic 
	                    	applications, image manipulation programs, desktop publishing, and many other applications. The maximum images can be saved in TIFF format is 4 GB. </p>

	                    	affect the image quality. When using the Web, TIFF files are typically converted to JPEG (or JPG) and BMP formats. The positive thing about this 
	                    	image format is that it is faster to load and more easily read by web browsers. </p>
