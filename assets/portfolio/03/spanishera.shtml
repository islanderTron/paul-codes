        <p>Spanish people arrived on Guam in 1521 with a fleet of three small ships.  They were hungry and weak from the long travel.  Chamorro people saw the three ships and decided to come to help to their aid to feed the hungry.  The Spanish people eventually established there for trading between Mexico and the Philippine.  They had a strong influence on the Chamorro people with many things; such as, religion, language, clothing style, and food.  Unfortunately, the result was the destruction of the old way of life of the native people there and many of their beliefs and practice, which resulted in the Spanish-Chamoru War between 1671 and July 1695 that resulted in the deaths of thousands of native inhabitants (a great percentage due to European diseases).</p>
