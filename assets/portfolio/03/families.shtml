        <p>This culture is very different than America’s culture because Guam’s culture is more likely to welcome anyone to join their party even though they are strangers.  They would encourage people to eat a plateful of food and then fill up a second plateful to take home.  When young Chamorro people go visit their aunts, uncles, or/and grandparents at their home, they must give a kiss to the top of their hand or cheek to show respect and manners to the elders.  </p>
		<p>In my experience of living on Guam when I was younger with my parents, we went to my grandma in Dededo, one of Guam’s villages, I had to go to her and give her a kiss on her hand or cheek to show my respect. </p>
