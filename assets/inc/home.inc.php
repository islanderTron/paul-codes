                        <p class="p-color">I am Paul Jerome Uncangco.  I was born and grew up on the island of Guam.  My legal guardian and I moved to the United States when I was 11 years old.  We moved around to enhance our educational and work opportunities. As a result, I became involved in a variety of outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, snorkeling and diving.  These provide balance from working on the computer most of the day. I graduated from National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID)/Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology.</p>
