        <h1> Gu&aring;h&aring;n's History</h1>
        <p>Chamorros are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands who lived on the island of Guam. Many centuries ago, before the Chamorro people met the Spanish, they used the Chamorro language and their beliefs were spiritual. Later, the Spanish influenced the Chamorro people to change their language and beliefs.  Their language became blended with the Spanish language as well as their religious/spiritual beliefs, which changed to Catholic.</p>
