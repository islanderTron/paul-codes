        <h1> Gu&aring;h&aring;n's Activities</h1>
        <p>Guam is really a small island at 30 miles long and 4-12 miles wide; however there are many activities that people can do.  There are three popular outdoor activities on Guam, which are hiking, scuba diving, and the beaches!</p>

        <p>Guam's lifestyle is much different from the U.S.  They are quite laid back and generally calm. U.S people will notice that people of Guam love barbeques, which is really the most popular food on Guam.  During special events or holiday, they usually cook barbeques with a wide variety of meat at the beach.</p>
